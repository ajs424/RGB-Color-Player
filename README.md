# RGB-Color-Player

A responsive and interactive game created for developers and designers to help them memorize RGB color codes. In an effort to hone in on my JavaScript and DOM manipulation skills, this game was implemented in raw JavaScript. 

The game's objective is simple. Players are presented with an RGB color code which they must match to a corresponding color swatch. Players can choose to play in an easy, medium, or hard level and are able to reset the color code and swatches anytime they please .
